# 0.30 WebGL

0.30 WebGL is a full WebGL port of a modded version of Minecraft Classic 0.30 Survival Test I made. 0.30 WebGL can be played on low-end devices like Chromebooks and can be played in the web browser.

## How to play?
You can play the game in the web browser using [this link](https://minecraft-classic-forever.peytonplayz595.repl.co/). If that doesn't work than try [this](https://peytonplayz595.github.io/0.30-WebGL/js/). If it still doesn't work open an issue [here](https://github.com/PeytonPlayz595/0.30-WebGL/issues).
Reasons why it may not work could be your browser doesn't support [WebGL 2.0](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGL_API), [Mouse Lock](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Pointer_Lock_API), or [IndexedDB](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IndexedDB_API) or it could also be some driver issue causing it not to load.
