Reasons why it may not work could be your browser doesn't support [WebGL 2.0](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGL_API), [Mouse Lock](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Pointer_Lock_API), or [IndexedDB](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IndexedDB_API) or it could also be some driver issue causing it not to load.
